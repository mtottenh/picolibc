=====

plibc (p for pico) is a small 'replacement' for a traditional C standard
library such as glibc.

It's main goal is to be educational and expose the various challenges involved
in creating a glibc replacement. As such it's designed to be easy to read, not
nessecarily performant (or strictly compliant). In no way is it a full
replacement for a traditional library like glibc/ulibc. Indeed many of the
expected features for a C library will probably go un-implemented.



To create the library:
====================
mkdir build
cd build && ../configure
make

Run tests
=========
make check


install plibc
================
make install

Using plibc 
===========

To actualy use plibc in your programs you need to link with the following:

gcc -nostdlib -o foo start.S foo.c -lplibc 

start.S must be used to call main() within your program, and is generally
platform specific, an example can be found at src/asm/start.S
